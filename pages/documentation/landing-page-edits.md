The Miles Ahead Portal is fully customizable, and you can create any templates or designs you like.

However, the default design allows for fast content edits and the ability to quickly change the logo and hero image.

To edit the content simply update the appropriate elements in the index.html file in the root of the project.

To change the hero image, replace the file named 900x550.png in the /assets/images folder.

To change the logo, replace the file named 495x225-logo.png in the /assets/images folder.
